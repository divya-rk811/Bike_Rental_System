# Bike Rental System - DBMS Project
This repository contains the SQL implementation and database design for a Bike Rental System developed as part of an academic DBMS project. The project demonstrates database normalization, entity-relationship modeling, and efficient SQL queries to manage users, bikes, bookings, payments, and administrative operations.


## Project Overview

The Bike Rental System is designed to help manage:
- User registrations and profiles
- Bike inventory and availability
- Booking and rental transactions
- Payment records and billing
- Location-based bike tracking
- Admin-level control for managing users and bikes

The primary focus of this project is on the **database design and SQL implementation**, which includes DDL, DML, and PL/SQL components.

## Key Features

- **Normalized Database** (up to 3NF) for efficiency and minimal redundancy
- **Secure and Logical Structure** for handling real-world rental operations
- **Stored Procedures** to automate common operations (e.g., booking a bike)
- **Triggers** to maintain data integrity (e.g., stock update after booking)
- **Sample Queries** for analytics and insights (e.g., most rented bikes, revenue per location)

## Database Tables

The project includes the following main tables:

- `User` – Stores customer information
- `Admin` – Stores admin credentials
- `Bike` – Stores bike inventory and availability status
- `Location` – Stores city/location info for bikes
- `Booking` – Stores rental records for users
- `Payment` – Stores payment details for completed bookings
